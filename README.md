# Social Comparison and Cooperation. An Experimental Approach
This paper proposes an laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of
social comparison and fairness in cooperation. I consider a two-person public
good game with heterogeneity in the subjects' endowment distribution. Some
workers receive homogeneous pay-rate (fair wages), while other workers receive
unjustified heterogeneous pay-rates (unfair wages). I proposed an empirical
strategy to check plausible hypothesis derived from the literature and from
the main social preferences models. The main testable predictions are that:
(i) participants cooperate more if they have a higher salary, (ii) participants
cooperate less if they face unequal wage distribution and, (iii) participants
cooperate less between each other if they have different unjustified salaries.
